/**
 * Function which takes in two arguments and produces a result.
 * However these kind of functions donâ€™t return any value.
 *
 * Hence this "functional interface" takes in one generic namely:
 *     "T": denotes the type of the input argument to the operation
 *
 * The "lambda expression" assigned to an object of "ObjLongConsumer" type is used to define its "accept()" which
 * eventually applies the given operation on its argument.
 *
 * It takes in a "long-valued" and a "T-valued" argument and is expected to operate without any side effects.
 * It is more like using an object of type "BiConsumer<T, Long>" except the fact that one is a reference and one is a
 * primitive java_regular.data type in this case.
 *
 * Hence we will be obtaining one reference and one value when this function is called.
